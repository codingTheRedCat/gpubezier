# Rendering quadratic Bezier curves
## Area
To render the area between the Bezier curve and line defined by the first and the 
last control point let's estimate the fraction of pixels area common with the curve area.
Let's assume the pixel is 1x1 square, so then the desired fraction will be just the common
area described ealier.
